    Welcome to the **Plant Disease Recognition** System! ðŸŒ¿
    
    This system uses advanced deep learning models to identify and diagnose diseases in **Corn**, **Grapes**, **Potatoes**, and **Tomatoes**. Simply upload a clear image of a leaf, and our model will analyze it to detect any potential disease. Our aim is to help farmers and agricultural professionals make quick and accurate decisions to protect their crops.
    
    Whether you're a farmer, researcher, or agriculture enthusiast, our platform offers you a simple, efficient, and accurate way to monitor plant health. Explore the platform and take a step towards sustainable farming!
    
    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a leaf of plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Get Started

    #### Dataset
    This system works on a dataset which consists of around 28k RGB images of 256x256 resolution. These images are classified into 21 classes on basis of their respective plant and diseases. These 21 classes include Corn(3 diseases), Grape(3 diseases), Potato(2 diseases), Tomato(9 diseases).
    #### Model
    Our Plant Disease Recognizer leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to accurately identify various diseases affecting crops. We trained the model on a comprehensive dataset containing thousands of labeled images of plant leaves across 21 classes, representing healthy and diseased conditions.
                
    To enhance accuracy, our model utilizes multiple layers of convolutional and pooling operations, followed by fully connected dense layers. By analyzing the features extracted from leaf images, the model makes precise predictions.
                
    Our model is designed to help in early disease detection, which is crucial for timely intervention and crop health management.

    ### Instructions
    1. Single Leaf Focus: Ensure that only one leaf is visible and in focus in the image. Avoid including multiple leaves.
    2. Clear Background: Use a plain or minimal background to reduce noise. A light or neutral-colored background works best.
    3. Leaf Orientation: Place the leaf flat and capture it from a top-down view. Avoid angles that obscure parts of the leaf.
    4. Good Lighting: Ensure the leaf is well-lit with natural or white light. Avoid shadows or reflections on the leaf.
    5. Image Quality: Use a clear, high-resolution image. Avoid blurry or pixelated pictures.
    6. No Additional Objects: Make sure there are no other objects (e.g., hands, soil, or tools) in the frame.
    Follow these instructions for accurate results.
